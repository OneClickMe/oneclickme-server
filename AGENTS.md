# Repository Guidelines

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [development conventions](docs/conventions.md) for the detailed team agreements.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/main/java/com/hsu/oneclickme/`: Spring Boot application code. Organize features under `domain/member`, `domain/place`, etc.; reserve `global` for shared configuration, exception handling, and base entities. Create packages when needed.
- `src/main/resources/`: application configuration and resources; no frontend assets currently exist.
- `src/test/java/`: tests mirroring production packages.
- `.github/`: issue forms and PR template. `docs/`: development conventions.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Java 21 and the committed Gradle wrapper:

- `./gradlew build`: compile, run tests, and package the application.
- `./gradlew test`: run the test suite.
- `./gradlew test --tests '*OneclickmeApplicationTests'`: run the existing context test.
- `./gradlew bootRun`: start the application locally.

Provide MySQL datasource settings before running the application or context-loading tests. The current `application.yaml` only declares the application name.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Match existing indentation: tabs in Java/Gradle and two spaces in YAML. No formatter or linter is configured yet; avoid unrelated reformatting.

Use `PascalCase` classes, `camelCase` methods/fields, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants. Name roles explicitly, such as `PlaceService` and `CreatePlaceRequest`.

Use records for DTOs and ordinary `@Entity` classes with necessary getters and protected no-argument constructors. Do not use Lombok `@Data` or class-wide entity setters. Prefer constructor injection with `private final` dependencies. Return response DTOs directly; use `ProblemDetail` with codes such as `COMMON-0400` for errors.

## Testing Guidelines

Use JUnit Jupiter and Spring Boot testing support. Follow the existing `*Tests` class suffix and descriptive test-method names. For behavior changes, test the relevant success and failure paths. No coverage percentage is configured. Report actual verification results or blockers in the PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history includes `chore: 개발 컨벤션 및 GitHub 협업 템플릿 추가`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, or `refactor` commits without emojis.

Follow GitHub Flow: branch from `main` using `type/issue-number`, such as `feat/12`. Target `main`, use the PR template, link issues, and record verification. PR titles include emojis, for example `✨ [Feat] 로그인 API 제작`; preserve that title in the final Squash commit.

Require one other developer's approval. Automatic approval dismissal is disabled by convention; CODEOWNERS is not used.

## Configuration Status

Docker/Compose and local/dev profiles are planned, not implemented. Initial local development will use `create-drop`; dev schema settings remain undecided and Flyway is deferred. Keep credentials outside Git. The lead will configure CI/CD for automatic dev deployment on `main` merges.
